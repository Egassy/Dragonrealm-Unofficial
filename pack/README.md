Chromatiless version exists for people with poor connections, such as myself.
For this version, manually download Chromaticraft from https://dragonrealm.overminddl1.com/downloads/ReikaMods/ChromatiCraft%201.7.10%20V33a.jar and place it in the `mods` folder. Then, replace line 5 in `unsup.ini` with `source=https://github.com/Egassy/Dragonrealm-Unofficial/raw/refs/heads/main/chromatilesspack/pack.toml`. Then continue as normal.
