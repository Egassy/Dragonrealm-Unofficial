# DragonRealm

[ReikaKalseki](https://github.com/ReikaKalseki/)'s DragonRealm modpack, converted into packwiz format for easier install and distribution and modified for modernity.

All credit for the modpack goes to [ReikaKalseki](https://github.com/ReikaKalseki), and to [OvermindDL1](https://github.com/OvermindDL1) for hosting the required files.

[DragonRealm Warnings](https://dragonrealm.overminddl1.com/warning.php) are still in effect. Do not use `/mt reload` or update mods, and ensure you follow proper installation procedure, as listed below. Do not report any errors or bugs in the pack to [ReikaKalseki](https://github.com/ReikaKalseki/), as this is an **unofficial**, modified version which has not been vetted or endorsed by her.

~~Chromatiless version exists for people with poor connections. Additional instructions are in its own README.md~~ Fixed with an Unsup update. Thank you Unascribed!

# Installation (client)

0. Requires between 3072mb and 5120mb of RAM allocated, with an equal amount of spare.

1. Download and install an "Empty export" from Releases. It uses [unsup](https://git.sleeping.town/unascribed/unsup/) to download files, with the files to download being defined in this repo, so it will always be up to date.

2. In the Java arguments/parameters section of the new Minecraft instance, paste `-javaagent:unsup-1.1.5.jar -DragonAPI_disable_ASM_RIVERGENLAYEREVENT -DragonAPI_enable_ASM_NOOCWORLDRIFT`. Not required if using Prism and the Prism release.

3. Set your desired world radius in `/config/DragonAPI.cfg` on line 64. Default is 25000 radius, so you'll have to go a good distance to find many biomes on that.

4. Launch.

5. Create world with seed `6671894640346020928`.

5.4 Something needs to be done with TerritoryZone, however there is no documentation about *what* that is, and the Territory Planner block (`DragonRealmCore:tile.terrloc`) causes crashes in singleplayer, so until such a time as I can figure out exactly what needs to happen... *shrug*. Hopefully it works.

5.5. If you want to use another seed, or this does not work (world's biome map is broken), follow the final four instructions on the [DragonRealm Installation](https://dragonrealm.overminddl1.com/installation.php) page. Alternatively, copy the contents of `/saves/<worldname>/worldSpecificConfig/ClimateControl` to `/config/ClimateControl`, delete the world, then recreate it. This step is **experimental**, and if you are unsure you should verify.

6. Play DragonRealm.


# Installation (server)

0. Requires between 6144mb and 8192mb of RAM allocated, with an equal amount of spare. If you are using a dedicated server hosting service, don't worry about the spare.

1. Download `unsup-1.0.s.jar` from [Unascribed's git releases](https://git.sleeping.town/unascribed/unsup/releases/tag/v1.0.2), and place it in the root of your server instance.

2. Download `unsup.ini` from the [misc-files](https://github.com/Egassy/Dragonrealm-Unofficial/tree/main/misc-files) folder and place it in the root of your server instance, then add `no_gui=true` to it on line 3.

3. Add `-javaagent:unsup-1.0.2.jar -DragonAPI_disable_ASM_RIVERGENLAYEREVENT -DragonAPI_enable_ASM_NOOCWORLDRIFT` as Java args

4. In `server.properties`, set `level-seed` to `level-seed=6671894640346020928`

4.4 Something needs to be done with TerritoryZone, however there is no documentation about *what* that is, and the Territory Planner block (`DragonRealmCore:tile.terrloc`) causes crashes in singleplayer, so until such a time as I can figure out exactly what needs to happen... *shrug*. Hopefully it works.

4.5. If you want to use another seed, or this does not work (world's biome map is broken), follow the final four instructions on the [DragonRealm Installation](https://dragonrealm.overminddl1.com/installation.php) page. Alternatively, start the server and generate the world, stop the server, copy the contents of `/world/worldSpecificConfig/ClimateControl` to `/config/ClimateControl`, delete `world`, then start the server again. This step is **experimental**, and if you are unsure you should verify.

5. After Unsup has downloaded the pack files, set your desired world radius in `/config/DragonAPI.cfg` on line 64. Default is 25000 radius, so you'll have to go a good distance to find many biomes on that, but servers require a larger max world than singleplayer worlds, so it is likely acceptable.

6. Launch your client instance of DragonRealm, join and play.
