ReikaKalseki's Dragonrealm modpack, converted into packwiz format for easier install and distribution and modified for modernity.

All credit for the modpack goes to ReikaKalseki, and to Overmindd for hosting the required files.

[Dragonrealm Warnings](https://dragonrealm.overminddl1.com/warning.php) are still in effect. Do not use `/mt reload` or update mods, and ensure you follow proper installation procedure. Do not report any errors or bugs in the pack to ReikaKalseki, as this is an **unofficial**, modified version which has not been vetted or endorsed by her.

~~Chromatiless version exists for people with poor connections. Additional instructions are in its own README.md~~ Fixed with an Unsup update. Thank you Unascribed!
